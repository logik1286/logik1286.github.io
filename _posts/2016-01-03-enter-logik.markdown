Welcome to Quik Logik, both you and I.

I'm using this blog to share my progress in preparing my professional tool belt for my next career move.  I feel like I'm at a near dead end in my current industry and would like be involved with something more exciting, namely computational biology.
 
My background involves a mix of algorithms and performance computing, so naturally I'm looking to apply those skills to protein folding, cell modeling, drug discovery, and other things of the sort.  My plan is to get educated on the core sciences of these fields, build a portfolio reflecting it, and make a move. Profit may follow, good experiences are guaranteed, and if I'm really lucky I'll make a couple of friends along the way.

I'll be doing this by sharing source code, experiments, benchmarks, and writing a few tutorials.  Hardware wise I'll be looking at CPUs, integrated and discrete GPUs, and maybe cellphone processors (SoCs). Software wise I'll begin with C++11, CUDA, OpenCL, and MATLAB (if money permits). We'll see what this blog DNA folds into. :)

Who am I? A pen name, a URL, and an e-mail address. For now. I'm not terribly keen on posting my personals online. I'll connect the blog to myself with discretion and upon request (logik1286@gmail.com). Just double check it's actually me that's sending you here.
