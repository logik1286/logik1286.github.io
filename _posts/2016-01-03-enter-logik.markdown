Welcome to Quik Logik, both you and I.

My background involves a mix of algorithms and performance computing, so naturally I'm looking to apply those skills to protein folding, cell modeling, drug discovery, and other things of the sort.  My plan is to get educated on the core sciences of these fields, build a portfolio reflecting it, and see where things go.

I'll be doing this by sharing source code, experiments, benchmarks, and writing a few tutorials.  Hardware wise I'll be looking at CPUs, integrated and discrete GPUs, and maybe cellphone SoCs. Software wise I'll begin with C++11, CUDA, OpenCL, and MATLAB (money permitting). We'll see what this blog DNA folds into. :)

Who am I? A pen name, a URL, and an e-mail address. For now. I'm not terribly keen on posting my personals online. I'll connect the blog to myself upon request.
