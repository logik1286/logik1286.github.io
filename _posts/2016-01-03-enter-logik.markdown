Welcome to Quik Logik, both you and I.

This site is about my journey into computational biology. I've got a few years of experience in performance optimization and algorithm design for medical imaging, so I'm looking to apply those skills to protein folding, cell modeling, drug discovery, and so on.  My plan is to get educated on the core sciences of these fields, find some open source projects in need of a speed up, and have at it. 

I'm planning on sharing source code, experiments, and benchmarks, as well as writing a few tutorials.  Hardware wise I'll be looking at CPUs, integrated and discrete GPUs, and maybe cellphone SoCs. Software wise I'll begin with C++11, CUDA, OpenCL, and MATLAB (money permitting). We'll see what this blog DNA folds into. :)

Who am I? A pen name, a URL, and an e-mail address for now. I'm not terribly keen on posting my personals online. I'll connect the blog to myself upon request.
