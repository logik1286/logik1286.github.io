My page now shares something in common with my face - ain't pretty, but good enough. (You'll find that I'm full of one liners if you follow this blog).

Just a few updates to the color scheme to match my personal preferences. Just registered a domain name with Google since this whole <username>.github.io stuff is a mouthful. I'm very thankful for the team that put Jekyll and Github together; I'm no webmaster and have gotten online with little effort and cost.

Speaking of effort and cost, I have a new friend showing up in a bunch of boxes on Friday. I'll have a post about it once it's put together.
